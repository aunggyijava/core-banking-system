1. Verify the Eureka Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to:
http://localhost:8761
You should see the Eureka dashboard, showing that the registry is running but with no registered services yet.

2. Register Other Services

When creating other services (e.g., account-service, customer-service), add the Eureka client dependency and 
configure the application.yml to point to the Service Registry:

eureka:
  client:
    service-url:
      defaultZone: http://localhost:8761/eureka/
